                <p class="card-text">A spatula is one of the most common cooking tools. It's a simple tool that is basically a flat, usually squarish piece of plastic or metal, on the end of a straight handle. It also goes by the names of tosser, turner and flipper and even fish slice. As these names suggest, the tool is basically used for flipping food, usually in a frying pan. For example, you might use a spatula to flip a burger patty. Some blades have slots or holes in them to facilitate draining food, and others are solid. Another variation of spatulas do not have such pronounced ends, and are made of a more pliable material, useful for mixing and scraping bowls of cake batter.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">How a hand mixer works</h5>
                <p class="card-text">To use a handheld mixer, you first plug it in and attach two balloon whisks. Place the mixer in your bowl of ingredients and select the speed setting you want. Turn it on by pushing a switch. The whisks start to rotate due to an electric motor inside the device. The whisks will mix, beat or whip the ingredients, depending on your speed setting. They will also incorporate air into your ingredients, giving them a "fluffier" texture. You often move the bowl while using your mixer, to make sure every ingredient is thoroughly mixed.</p>

                <p class="card-text">A stand mixer works similar to a handheld, with the difference that you attach a bowl (often a stainless steel bowl) to it and you do not have to hold the mixer. After affixing the bowl to the mixer, you add the preferred attachment (such as a dough hook for bread ingredients) and select the desired speed setting. You then flip the switch, and a large motor will rotate the attachment. Let it work as long as it needs. You may have to scrape the attachment during the mixing, such as when too much of the dough sticks to the hook.</p>
